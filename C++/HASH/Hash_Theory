INTRODUCTION

Hashing is a process of converting data (like text or files) into a fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash value. 
It's commonly used for data retrieval and verification because even a small change in the original data results in a significantly 
different hash, making it useful for tasks like password storage and data integrity checks.
